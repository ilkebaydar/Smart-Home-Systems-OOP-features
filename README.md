This exercise focuses on developing a smart home automation system that manages IoT devices such as smart lights, thermostats, and security cameras. The system will
 allow users to add and control these devices, turning them on or off while tracking their power consumption. It will also keep count of the total number of devices in the system.
 The smart home system will include a central controller that manages multiple devices, providing functionalities for adding, removing, and displaying their statuses. Each device
 will have a unique ID, name, type, power consumption rating, and operational status. Devices will be stored within an internal collection and will support dynamic memory
 allocation for flexible management. The exercise will demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts, including encapsulation, constructors, destructors, copy constructors, static members, and constant methods.
